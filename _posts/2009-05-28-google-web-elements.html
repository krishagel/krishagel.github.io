Yesterday at <a href="http://code.google.com/events/io/">Google I/O</a>, their developers conference, Google Debuted a new product that could help people simplify publishing of Google Apps generated content.  They have created simple widgets that you fill in your information about the content, and they give you the simple javascript code to insert it into your own web pages, blogs, etc.  A simple example is a widget they have for simply publishing presentations created in Google Apps.  You can see the slides from our ACPE presentation below:<br /><br /><!-- Google Presentations Element Code --><br /><iframe marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" border="0" style="border: 0pt none ; margin: 0pt; width: 410px; height: 342px;" src="http://docs.google.com/EmbedSlideshow?id=dgktzrmz_0cggtbwcr&amp;element=true" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><br /><br />It took a grand total of about 20 seconds to paste in the url of the presentation, and then copy the javascript for inclusion in this blog post.  Can't get much easier than that.  You can find more information at <a href="http://www.google.com/webelements">http://www.google.com/webelements</a>
