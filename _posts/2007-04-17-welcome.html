Well, i have finally decided it is about time to get started blogging about the things I do on a daily basis.  I have been planning to start this a while ago but I haven't had the time until now. <br /><br />I think there is quite a community out there who struggle with the same issues I do working in a public school district that has limited financial resources, yet still has the expectations that we are a full blown corporate enterprise.<br /><br />I will try and blog about successes we have in our work and the struggles we have as well.  I also intend to talk about many other issues as they come up, such as the use of open source in K-12 education, and opportunities that exist in the new Web 2.0 world for education.
