As you may have noticed, some of my recent posts were a bit messed up at the bottom.  I was using a <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/748&amp;sa=U&amp;start=1&amp;ei=qk0MSr__DZmWswPk3eX7Ag&amp;sig2=Df8XeJJJe1nElwdysB32-A&amp;usg=AFQjCNEpPhI0GN5AETG5W3udiA7KMt7xNA">Greasemonkey</a> script called Greased Lightbox to simplify viewing pictures from websites like Digg, or Google Search Results.  Unfortunately it also had the effect of adding a bunch of worthless junk to posts that I made that included pictures.  This has now been remedied, and any of the posts that had this have been cleaned up.  I apologize for any inconvenience.
