So this year I am unable to attend <a href="http://www.iste.org/necc">NECC</a> or any other conferences out of state due to budget reductions occurring in our district.  I was even accepted to speak again this year, but had to decline.  Anyway enough of my back story.<br /><br />So this year I am attempting to follow what is going on at NECC through <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23necc09">Twitter</a> and blogs that I currently read.  And much like other in-person events I have attempted to follow virtually (<a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23wwdc">WWDC</a> &amp; <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23googleio">Google I/O</a>), the amount of information coming out of these events is overwhelming.<br /><br />But with that being said, I did have some free time to follow what is going on, and since the conference hasn't fully kicked off, it was possible to find some really interesting and thought provoking tweets from today that I think should really be seen by a greater audience.  Here are some of those:<br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-style: italic;">There shouldn't be an Acceptable Use Policy, you should have a RESPONSIBLE Use Policy. -someone at my session. </span><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://twitter.com/imcguy">@imcguy</a></span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><br />Don't call it Social Networking, it's Educational Networking - Doug Johnson. </span><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://twitter.com/imcguy">@imcguy</a></span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-style: italic;">@ittosde @imcguy I want districts to have an Empowered Use Policy. =) You, as a student/employee, have the right to be empowered to... <a href="http://twitter.com/mcleod">@mcleod</a></span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Re: web filtering... "we know some kids will drink on prom night- we don't fix it by closing down prom" ~ <a href="http://twitter.com/mcleod">@mcleod</a></span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;font-size:85%;" >We spend so much time teaching appropriate use. We need to teach EMPOWERED use as well. <a href="http://twitter.com/bethstill">@bethstill</a></span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How about if we teach CTS computer programming by having kids learn to program iTouch apps. Bet that would engage students!! <a href="http://twitter.com/kaminskiterry">@kaminskiterry</a></span></span><br /><br />As I try and keep up on this knowledge deluge the next few days, I will try and post some of the more interesting things here <a href="http://twitter.com/krishagel">Tweet</a> about them
