Ok, so I know I said I was back and going to start blogging again back in December, but I guess that kind of fell apart.  This time I have actually made a list of things I want to write about, and it is currently at about 14, so I will try and write a couple of things up tonight, and over the next week or two, I will try to get to all of them.  The topics are a real mix 'n match of different topics that touch on what it is like to manage an IT department in a K-12 setting where you never will have the resources that a private enterprise will.
