Well, it took me some time to get home, and get my life back together after NECC this year, but I am finally back into the swing of things.  I have also finally posted my slides for anyone looking for them from my presentation.  You can find them <a href="http://presentations.bethelsd.org/necc2007/slides.pdf">here</a>, and they are also now uploaded to the NECC site as well.<div><br /></div><div>For those of you who did attend my presentation, I should know soon when we will be able to release the structure of our data warehouse.  I will keep you up-to-date via this blog as I know more.</div><div><br /></div><div>I want to thank everyone who did attend and if there is anything I can do to help you, please let me know.</div>
