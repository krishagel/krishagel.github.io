As I promised in the presentation, here are the slides from the presentation we gave this morning.  I want to thank everyone who came, as we had a really great discussion both in the session, and in the backchannel on Twitter, I think some people really got some good information.  As I mentioned, if you have any questions for any of us, please get in touch, and we will be happy to help or share our experience.<br /><br />Presentation Slides:<br /><a href="http://bit.ly/QNEY1">http://bit.ly/QNEY1</a>
