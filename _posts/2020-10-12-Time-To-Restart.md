title: Time To Breathe Life Into This Old Blog
---

I recently ran across a great [personal site](https://samselikoff.com/) that has inspired me to clean up my old blog and get it up and running on something a little more modern. So, as this is my first blog post since 2011 and back then I was just documenting a lot of technical solutions I had come up with back then, this will be a little different now. 

I plan to use this site as a work journal as well as a blog, so check back soon as I work to bring more content forward and also use this as a way to expand my own learning.
