Just this week I have been informed that I will be sitting on a panel at <a href="http://www.acpenw.org"><span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">ACPE</span></a> this year speaking about the intricacies of integrating Active Directory and Open Directory together in a school district setting.<br /><br />It has been almost two years since I got this working for us, so I will have to go back and do some research into what it was we actually did. <br /><br />Like always I wasn't excited about the suggested solutions that were out there from Apple and Microsoft.  I decided not to rely as heavily on Active Directory as all of those methods suggested.  Three years ago I made the decision that our data warehouse would be our authoritative directory, and with this in mind, AD and OD are merely separate systems that just sit out there and perform their duties.  We don't rely on a directory service as heavily as many others do, so that made this fairly simple.  Now we use AD strictly to manage Windows clients, and we use OD to manage all our OS X and Linux clients.<br /><br />I will post more about our specific setup as I have time to go back and recreate everything that was done.  I also will try and share what others that are on this panel are doing in this challenge endeavor as well.
