I am not sure if this is a new feature or not, but I saw it this week, and it really seems like a handy new addition to Google Reader.  They call it bundles, and you can see more <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2009/05/life-is-great-bundle-of-little-things.html">here</a>.  What it is essentially is a collection of RSS feeds that you can share out to whoever you want.<br /><br />There are great possibilities, especially in education, from getting people started with RSS, so create 10 feeds in a bundle that show them the information you can gain from RSS.  Another one that I will be using in the next few days is creating "bundles" of feeds that I read, so that my staff can also start reading the same things I do, and we can all get on the same page as far as the information we are working off of.<br /><br />Just as a sample to start working with this, I have created three bundles, and if you are so inclined, you can subscribe to them below.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.google.com/reader/bundle/user%2F01826383109090310462%2Fbundle%2FGoogle%20Feeds">Google Blogs and Information Bundle</a><br /><a href="http://www.google.com/reader/bundle/user%2F01826383109090310462%2Fbundle%2FActive%20Directory%20Feeds">Active Directory Blogs Bundle</a><br /><a href="http://www.google.com/reader/bundle/user%2F01826383109090310462%2Fbundle%2FWindows%20Server%20Feeds">Windows Server Technologies Bundle</a>
