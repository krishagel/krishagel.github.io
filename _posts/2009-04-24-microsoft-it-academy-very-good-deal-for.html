This year I decided to go a different route than our previous online training opportunity for our department staff.  We had previously used the service offered by <a href="http://www.ttclive.com/">The Training Consortium</a>, but this year, that was a little bit more expensive than we could afford, and needed something that could be used by more of the technical staff throughout the department.  We luckily stumbled upon Microsoft's Training opportunities through a contact at our local ESD, and so far have been happy we did.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/education/msitacademy/default.mspx">Microsoft IT Academy</a> is much more than just training, although there is a lot of that, and our experience so far, has been a pretty high quality.  When you purchase a subscription, (which provides access to all staff in your entire district) you also get access to MSDN, Microsoft Press, and TechNet Plus.  For the fairly small cost with the educational discounts, this is well worth the money spent.  They do also align the courses up with their certifications such as MCSE, and MCSA, and others, so if you have staff that are interested into these certifications, this is a great way to provide that opportunity to them.<br /><br />They also do offer this for use with students, but the way they license it is you must license each of your schools seperately, and for this year our schools already have a solution in place.<br /><br />I would fully recommend that you take a look at this if you are in the market for online training for your IT staff.  Of course it is Microsoft only technologies, but if you are like us and are supporting a primarily Windows infrastructure, it is well worth it.
