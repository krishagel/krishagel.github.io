Following up on yesterday's <a href="http://blog.krishagel.com/2009/06/following-conferences-virtually-is-like.html">post</a> about following conferences virtually without being there, I figured I would share some of the things I have seen today that may be interesting to others out there do the same thing as I am.<br /><br />Here are a couple of hashtags that may be good to follow <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23notatnecc09">#notatnecc09</a> &amp; <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23neccunplugged">#neccunplugged</a>.  <a href="http://www.neccunplugged.com/">NECC Unplugged</a> is starting tomorrow, and is more of an unconference existing inside the main conference and will be broadcasting all their sessions through Elluminate.<br /><br />Here's a live blog of Malcolm Gladwell's opening Keynote speech.  <span class="status-body"><span class="entry-content"></span></span><a href="http://bit.ly/dVteu" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/dVteu</a><br /><br />Site doing a great job of cataloging what is going on online at NECC for those of us unfortunate enough not to be there.  <a href="http://write4.net/19y">http://write4.net/19y</a><br /><br />Like yesterday, I found some interesting quotes via Twitter I would like to share, I have left out all of the Gladwell quotes, as you should be able to find those in any of the coverage of his keynote, but here are some of the others:<br /><span class="status-body"><strong><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;">#necc09 #necc #iste for that matter, as meaningful learning moves online, will classrooms be only for those too skillless to escape class? <a href="http://twitter.com/AndrewBWatt">@AndrewBWatt</a></span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;">The illiterate of the 21st c'y are not those who can't read or write, but those who can't learn, unlearn and relearn #NECC09 <a href="http://twitter.com/ISTEGlobal">@ISTEGlobal</a></span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;">Reading: "Utah University Lifts Ban on YouTube" <a href="http://tinyurl.com/md2jyt">http://tinyurl.com/md2jyt</a> Cites educational content. Shocking! If Brigham Young can do it... <a href="http://twitter.com/willrich45">@willrich45</a></span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;">Huge indictment of investment in IWBs instead of netbooks -- teacher-centered decision, not student-centered one #CCDC09 <a href="http://twitter.com/wsstephens">@wsstephens</a></span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;">if most students soon will have data access through their own devices and schools can't filter, how will schools react? #necc09 <a href="http://twitter.com/mhines">@mhines</a></span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;">#necc #neccunplugged "Technology has transformed our lives except in our schools" <a href="http://twitter.com/oysteinj">@oysteinj</a></span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;">Stager said student use of computers is often superficial. After all, getting images off digital camera should be a baseline skill #CCDC09 <a href="http://twitter.com/wsstephens">@wsstephens</a></span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;">Being able to get the computer to do something that it already doesn't do is a critical life skill. #ccdc09 <a href="http://twitter.com/lnitsche">@lnitsche</a><br /><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size:100%;">I'll try and keep this up for the rest of the conference, but with having to go back to work tomorrow, it may make it a bit harder.</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;"><br /></span></span></strong></span>
