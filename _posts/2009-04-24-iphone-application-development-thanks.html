In case you haven't already seen this in multiple places and you are interested in getting started in writing applications for the iPhone, take a look at the course that is being offered right now at Stanford and also offered to the world for no credit through iTunes U.<br /><br />I have watched a couple of the lectures so far, and am trying to keep up, but it just takes a bit more time than I currently have with everything else on my plate.  I have quite a few good ideas that I hope I can one day produce, but it all comes down to whether or not I will ever have time.  This is an actual college course though, so it does take you from the basics of learning Objective-C all the way to creating much more advanced applications.<br /><br />If you would like more information, search for Stanford within iTunes, or you can find the actual class website with all lecture slides, assignments, a direct iTunes link, and other information at the following link: <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/cgi-bin/index.php">http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/cgi-bin/index.php</a>
