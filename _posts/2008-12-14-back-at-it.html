Well, it has been a long time since I thought I would embark on blogging to try and share what my experiences are in K12 Technology, and to try and share my trials and tribulations so that others don't have to go through the same issues.<br /><br />I have finally settled into a new job now (1.5 years later) and we are finally starting to do some things that may be of interest to others.  I have some new ideas to share, so hopefully these new posts will start coming soon.<br /><br />Thanks.
