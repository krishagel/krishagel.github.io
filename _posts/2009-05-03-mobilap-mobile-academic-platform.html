Over the last month I have been working to customize a web application that will be used in an upcoming conference that I am a part of.  There is an expectation by the board of this conference that there will be a fairly high number of attendees that will have either iPod Touchs or iPhones.  Because of this, they found a web application originally developed by the the University of Cincinnati College of Design, Architecture, Art &amp; Planning called <a href="http://daap.uc.edu/mobilap/">MobilAP</a>.  I started looking into this application a couple of months ago and had hoped at the time, that the customization of the application would be assisted by vendors.  It turned out that the vendor we had hoped for assistance from had no resources that could be put into this task at this time, so that left all updating and customization on me.<br /><br />A few weeks ago, I spent a few hours customizing the look and feel of the application.  This was setup pretty easily as the download for the package included the project files from <a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/dashcode/">Dashcode</a>.  This allowed for simple look and feel changes to be done easily.  It also allowed for easy creation of new screens that were going to need to be added to the application for it to fit into what this conference had envisioned.<br /><br />This weekend arrived and since the conference starts next week, there was no time left to put this off, so I had to dig in and get to work customizing it.  The standard application has no portions built to provide a way to display promotional information from the vendors, so that had to be built in.<br /><br />After nearly 30 hours of work this weekend, I am proud to say that the application is complete and ready to go for the conference.  Some examples of the look and feel can be seen below:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_BBmDIqRhYWw/Sf5eCgpO8_I/AAAAAAAAAvk/lu4IOAndf34/s1600-h/Picture+1.png"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 244px; height: 320px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_BBmDIqRhYWw/Sf5eCgpO8_I/AAAAAAAAAvk/lu4IOAndf34/s320/Picture+1.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5331802406068876274" border="0" /></a><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_BBmDIqRhYWw/Sf5eJRt5sGI/AAAAAAAAAvs/hfJ5uIXmU2s/s1600-h/Picture+2.png"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 222px; height: 320px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_BBmDIqRhYWw/Sf5eJRt5sGI/AAAAAAAAAvs/hfJ5uIXmU2s/s320/Picture+2.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5331802522321006690" border="0" /></a>If there is anyone out there who needs to do something like this, please let me know, and I would be happy share with you the changes I made.  They aren't pretty, I haven't really done much coding for the last couple years, but they do function.  You can also get the original source code at the link for MobilAP above.
